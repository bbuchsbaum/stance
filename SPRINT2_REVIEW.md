# Sprint 2 Code Review & Refactor Summary

Sprint 2 introduced voxel-specific HRF estimation and a set of Rcpp kernels for the E-step. All new components compile on macOS, Linux and Windows CI. A review of the merged code identified several areas for follow‑up optimisation and laid out the roadmap for Sprint 3.

## Highlights

- **Rcpp E-step**: `compute_log_likelihoods_rcpp`, `forward_pass_rcpp` and `backward_pass_rcpp` provide >5× speedup compared with the R fallbacks. Unit tests (`tests/testthat/test-rcpp-e-step.R`) confirm numerical equivalence.
- **Voxel-specific HRFs**: `update_hrf_coefficients_batched_cpp` estimates HRF coefficients in blocks. End-to-end tests (`tests/testthat/test-end-to-end-hrf.R`) show reasonable recovery and verify performance.
- **Neuroim2/fmrireg integration**: HRF basis creation uses `fmrireg` functions, and neuroimaging data are handled via `neuroim2` helpers. Integration tests ensure compatibility across both matrix and `NeuroVec` inputs.

## Refactor Notes

1. **Shared Utilities**
   - Several private helpers in `continuous_bayesian_decoder.R` duplicate logic found in `utils.R`. These should be consolidated to reduce maintenance.
2. **Memory Usage**
   - The batched HRF update allocates multiple temporary matrices. Pre‑allocating workspace buffers will cut peak memory.
3. **Forward/Backward Symmetry**
   - The C++ forward and backward passes share nearly identical loops. A templated helper in `hmm_utils.h` would remove duplication.
4. **Documentation**
   - Roxygen comments for the new C++ functions are concise but could mention the expected input shapes and the role of `neuroim2` objects.

## Sprint 3 Planning

The next sprint will introduce a GMRF prior for spatially smoothed HRFs. Key action items:

- Implement neighbourhood extraction utilities using `neuroim2::NeuroSpace`.
- Extend `update_hrf_coefficients_batched_cpp` to accept the Laplacian matrix and apply the prior.
- Profile the M‑step again once spatial smoothing is active; further C++ optimisation may be needed for the GMRF solve.

With these steps the package will continue to integrate cleanly with the existing neuroimaging ecosystem while addressing the remaining performance bottlenecks.
